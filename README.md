## Dependencies

* >= Boost 1.70
* >= GCC 8 (for C++17 support)
* Headers and libraries in `install_deps.sh`

## Notes
* The `Makefile` looks for Boost in `opt/tools/boost/boost_1_70_0/include/`.

## Building

* In the root project directory: `make` to build the program, `make tests` to build the tests, and `make clean` to...clean.
